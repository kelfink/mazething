<title>Attempt to solve a maze of specified sizes</title>
<body id="body">
<p>
In this puzzle type, a mouse wants to start at one corner of the 'maze' and visit all locations with the maze, moving up, down, left or right.
The mouse want tot visit all locations in the grid, to get the treats from each one.  But she must not visit any cell more than once.
For each size, is it possible?  Can you predict which sizes wil let her win, and which will not?  Can you come up with a rule to predict success?

Try the program below to experiment.
